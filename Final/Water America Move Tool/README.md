For our school project, we are developing a feature for a Washington utility website that allows users to input their planned moving date and new address. The backend utilizes the USPS API for address verification and validates the moving date. On the specified date, the system automatically updates the user's address in the database. Additionally, users have the ability to edit or remove their moving information as needed. We are using Flask as the web framework, SQLAlchemy for database interactions, SQLite for data storage, and HTML for the frontend interface. This feature aims to enhance user experience by simplifying the process of updating utility services during a move while ensuring data accuracy through validation checks.
